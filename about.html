            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>â€ƒFries Oh My's is a family-owned business that has expanded into a worldwide chain that is enjoyed by many. Its' humble beginnings in Lexington, Indiana began directly with one young entrepreneur aboard the Mayflower in Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas who decided to open a business primarily for French Fries. The business has been passed on maybe not through blood family, but with like-minded family. In truth, the selection of the next CEO is unlike anything else in the industry, with the current owner selecting a random person anywhere in the world and offering to buy their property to establish a new chain right in front of their house, and if they agree, they become the new CEO. While it may be unorthodox, with a centuries' old legacy, it has proved its' worth generation after generation. As for the menu, it is only fries. There is no secret menu, it is only fries. The current CEO is Luke Brinkruff, a high school student who is finally bringing the chain into the 21st century by establishing a website.
